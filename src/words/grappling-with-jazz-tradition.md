[Jazzspeaks Interview](http://www.jazzspeaks.org/future-music-aaron-burnett-speaks/)

When asked for why he approaches composition and improvisation this way, he responded:

> I’m looking to the future of the music, rather than being a bit of a necrophiliac like a lot of jazz musicians out there. I’m trying to introduce a concept that will last longer than I’m alive. I’m a thirty-two-year-old man, which isn’t that long of a time to be alive. I look at our society, I look at everything that’s going on and what young people are listening to and what’s popular, and that’s what drives me to make music the way I do. I can sit there and play Dexter Gordon patterns all day, but what does that really do for the music? It doesn’t do anything. It’s regurgitating something that already happened. Playing jazz today, it’s much more interesting trying to incorporate all these modern elements into the music rather than trying to emulate something that happened fifty years ago.

This resonates with me.
