After 4 months without a full time job, I'm happy to starting as a Frontend Engineer with Best Buy Corporate, working on BestBuy.com. This comes on the tail end of a lot of time thinking over what my next job would look like. With just shy of 3 years of experience under my belt, I've transitioned from a (mostly) self-taught developer striving to build and prove competency at every turn to feeling confident in my skills and with more of an eye on what I want to personally get out of my work.

The rub for me is how music – something that's much more than a hobby for me, but also not really a viable full-on career option yet – fits into that equation. It's a dilemma I've mulled over a lot lately
